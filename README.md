Qlauncher

This is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) with some customizations:

- Right-align text by default.
- Apps use button, instead of label style.
- Removed daily wallpaper feature. This drops Internet permission.
- Removed lock screen feature. This drops Admin and Accessibility permissions. Double tap can be used to launch an app.
