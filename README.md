Qlauncher

This is a fork of [Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) with some customizations:

- Make text align to right by default.
- Use button style for home app labels.
- Remove daily wallpaper feature. Drop Internet permission.
- Double tap launches an app instead of locking screen. Drops Admin and Accessibility permissions.
